            <p>I grew up in Morrisville, Vermont, a beatiful area home to rivers, lakes, moutain biking trails, and closely located to one of the permeir ski resorts in the North East (Stowe Moutain Resort). As a result, growing up I spent a lot of time on my snowboard, mountain bike or at a local swimming hole. My hobbies have not changed, I still spend my free time outside, mountain biking, snowboarding, paddle boarding, or just relaxing by a river.</p>
            <p>Before learning to program I worked in the hospitality industry. I began as a dishwasher while I was in high school, and was later promoted to line cook. After working as a line cook throughout college, I began bartending and serving. ALthough, I'll always have a passion for cooking or mixing up a nice cocktail, I never saw food and beverage as a life-long career.</p>
            <p>Like many hospitality workers, I was put out of work by the COVID-19 pandemic, which offered me the oppurtunity to make a career pivot. After a couple cross country road trips in the summer and fall of 2020, I began to explore new options. I had always enjoyed puzzles and problems that required logic and critical thinking to solve, and had a few friends (including my brother) suggest I consider looking into computer programming as a possible career. After spending a some time messing around on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.org</a>, I decided to enroll in Burlington Code Academy's 12 week full-time software development bootcamp.</p>
